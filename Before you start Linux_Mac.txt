Please read the README inside the Docs folder, it's really detailed and really important.

If using this build system, it is essential to understand how to compile HAL-related projects using the scripts provided in the Labxx folder.

I tried to make this build system as simple as possible, but there are some really important things to keep in mind, all of which are outlined in the README.

Also, read "About folder names.txt" (it's in the Docs folder) if you want to know what you can and cannot safely rename.

Enjoy!
