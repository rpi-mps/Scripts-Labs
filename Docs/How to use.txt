How to use:

1. Download the correct archive for your OS and unzip it to wherever you want

2. Save your .c files in the relevant lab's "src" folder and your .h files in the corresponding "inc" folder***

3. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in the relevant lab's folder (the folder with the Compile/Upload/Cleanup files)
>> Windows: In the lab's folder, do File --> Command Prompt or just Shift + Right Click --> Open command window here (also works with PowerShell)
>> macOS: You need this: http://lifehacker.com/launch-an-os-x-terminal-window-from-a-specific-folder-1466745514
>> Linux: In the lab's folder, Right Click --> Open in Terminal

4. Type ".\Compile.bat" on Windows or "./Compile.sh" on macOS/Linux

5. Type ".\Upload.bat" on Windows or "./Upload.sh" on macOS/Linux

6. To clean up the compiled files (i.e. to reset the build system), type ".\Cleanup.bat" on Windows or "./Cleanup.sh" on macOS/Linux 

***Note: With this build system, .c and .h files can be made with your favorite editor. I highly recommend Atom, GitHub's official code editor.
