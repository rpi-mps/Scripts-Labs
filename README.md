RPI Microprocessor Systems Repository for STM32F769I-Discovery Kit: Build Scripts Labs

Build scripts versions of the STM32F769I-DISCO labs. 
This is mainly meant for people who prefer doing their own thing as opposed to using a full-fledged IDE.

The scripts themselves are included in each operating system's MPS zip folder, as is the corresponding Backend folder. These can be found here: [Link TBD - the zips are ~150MB each]

Current as of 9/2/2017.
