# Scripts-Labs
Compile Scripts labs for RPI Microprocessor Systems using the STM32F769I-Discovery kit.

This development envronment is mainly meant for people who prefer doing their own thing as opposed to using a full-fledged IDE.

The scripts themselves are included in each operating system's Scripts Binaries archive, in addition to the required OS-specific Backend folder. The Scripts Binaries archives are hosted in the OS-specific Scripts-[OS]-Binaries repositories.
